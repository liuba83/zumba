              Hi, I'm Hanna Kovalenko, a passionate musician and dedicated music
              educator. Born and raised in Kremenchug, Ukraine, I have devoted
              my life to music, both as a performer and a teacher. My journey
              began at a young age, and over the years, I have honed my skills
              in voice, piano, and alto saxophone, always striving to inspire
              others through the beauty of music.

        <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>
        <p class="journey-text-one">
          Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. With a
          strong voice and sharp ear, I started my musical path as a vocalist at
          children‚Äôs parties. Encouraged by my parents, I pursued formal
          training in piano and voice at the Kremenchug School of Music.
        </p>
        <p class="journey-text-two">
          I continued my education at the Kremenchuk Pedagogical College named
          after A.S. Makarenko, where I trained to become a music-focused
          primary school teacher, shaping young musicians from their very first
          notes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="performance-header">Performance and Achievements</h2>
        <p class="performance-text-one">
          As a member of the vocal studio "Obriy" for over 20 years, I performed
          as a soloist and soprano in a vocal quartet, which in 2001 was honored
          as a Folk Vocal Amateur Group. I expanded my skills by learning alto
          saxophone and blockflutes, and since 2006, I've been a wedding
          musician, combining vocals, saxophone, and songwriting.
        </p>
        <p class="performance-text-two">
          I‚Äôve also participated in ‚ÄúThe Voice of Ukraine,‚Äù ‚ÄúFolk Star,‚Äù and
          city festivals‚Äîaccompanying other singers and performing solo.

            I‚Äôve performed at events like ‚ÄúChristmas Together‚Äù and ‚ÄúBorscht
